# Sensitivity Analysis of ODEs and PDEs

## Takeaways

+ Local sensitivity analysis can propagate small uncertainties through a scientific model using a first order Taylor expansion.
+ Global sensitivity analysis uses many samples to decompose how a scientific model depends on individual inputs and their interactions.
