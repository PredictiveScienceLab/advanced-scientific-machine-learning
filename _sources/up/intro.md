# Uncertainty Propagation through Scientific Models

Uncertainty propagation is a very common task in scientific computing. It is the process of quantifying the uncertainty in the input of a model and propagating it through the model to quantify the uncertainty in the output. This is a very important task in many scientific fields, such as physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering.

I expect that you are familiar with the basics of probability theory and statistics. I also expect that you are familiar with Monte Carlo methods.
In this chapter, we will discuss how to propagate uncertainty through scientific models more efficiently than using Monte Carlo methods.

## Objectives

+ Quantify input uncertainty in scientific models.
+ Propagate uncertainties through a scientific models.
