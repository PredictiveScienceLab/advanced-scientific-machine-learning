# Basic Elements of Surrogate Modeling

## The idea of a surrogate model

Let $f:\Omega \to \mathbb{R}$ be a scientific model that is expensive to evaluate. 
We use $x$ in $\Omega$ to denote the input to the model and $y = f(x)$ to denote the output of the model.
Here $x$ could be random inputs, which we denoted by $\xi$ earlier, but it could also be design variables that we can control.

The idea of a surrogate model is to approximate $f$ with a simpler function $\hat{f}:\Omega \to \mathbb{R}$ that is cheaper to evaluate. The surrogate model is constructed using a set of training points $\{x_i, y_i = f(x_i)\}_{i=1}^n$.
