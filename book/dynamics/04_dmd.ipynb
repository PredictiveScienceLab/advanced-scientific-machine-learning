    "# Dynamic Mode Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a method that identifies linear dynamics from high-dimensional data. It combines POD in space with Fourier analysis in time. The benefits of DMD are:\n",
    "+ It is purely data-driven, requiring no prior knowledge of the system.\n",
    "+ It is computationally efficient, requiring only basic linear algebra.\n",
    "+ It can provide insight into the underlying dynamics of the system.\n",
    "+ It can be used to predict future states of the system.\n",
    "+ It can account for control inputs and external forcing.\n",
    "+ It forms the backbone of more advanced techniques, such as data-driven Koopman analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some drawbacks to DMD:\n",
    "+ It is a linear method, so it cannot capture nonlinear dynamics, transient behavior, or bifurcations.\n",
    "+ It has trouble with traveling waves, such as shock waves or solitons.\n",
    "+ It requires a large amount of data to accurately capture the dynamics.\n",
    "+ It can be sensitive to noise in the data.\n",
    "+ It requires a lot of sensor data, which may not always be available.\n",
    "\n",
    "## References\n",
    "\n",
    "+ This notebook follows closely the exposition in [Chapter 7.2](http://databookuw.com) of \"Data-Driven Science and Engineering\" by Brunton and Kutz."
