# Basics of MCMC

I have explained the basics of MCMC in [Lecture 27 of ME 539](https://predictivesciencelab.github.io/data-analytics-se/lecture27/intro.html).
There we used pyro with PyTorch. Here we are going to use numpyro with Jax.

The basics of MCMC as well as the diagnostics are discussed in Chapter 11 of [Bayesian Data Analysis by Gelman et al.](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/). The book is freely available online.
