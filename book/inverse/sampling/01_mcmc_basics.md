# Basics of MCMC

I have explained the basics of MCMC in [Lecture 27 of ME 539](https://predictivesciencelab.github.io/data-analytics-se/lecture27/intro.html).
There we used [pyro](https://pyro.ai/) with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) to implement MCMC algorithms.
Here we will use [Blackjax](https://blackjax-devs.github.io/blackjax/index.html#) and [numpyro](https://num.pyro.ai/en/latest/index.html), both of which use Jax.

The basics of MCMC as well as the diagnostics are discussed in Chapter 11 of [Bayesian Data Analysis by Gelman et al.](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/). The book is freely available online. It is an excellent book.
